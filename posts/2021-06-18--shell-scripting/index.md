Shell scripting is a method you  can use to set up font build workflows that are approachable, scalable, and repeatable. I presented a tutorial on shell scripting in a presentation at the 2021 Typographics TypeLab.

The tutorial exists in a project repo at: [github.com/arrowtype/typelab-2021](https://github.com/arrowtype/typelab-2021)

There is also [a recorded version of the presentation on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj_YznWx3SQ&t=375s&ab_channel=ArrowType).

Happy scripting!
