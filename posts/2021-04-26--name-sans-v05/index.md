[Name Sans](https://name.arrowtype.com) is a modern interpretation of the mosaic name tablets of the NYC Subway. It is currently available with discounted pre-release pricing [via Future Fonts](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/arrowtype/name-sans). 

Name Sans is now in its fifth pre-release version – `0.5` – so I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what the family is, how it has evolved since v0.1, and where it’s headed in the future. My favorite typefaces are always released along with an introductory article. In a way, you can think of this as the “v0.5” blog post introducing Name Sans, its process, and its design.

## What is Name Sans, anyway?

Releasing Name Sans progressively through Future Fonts has helped me to search for what it really should be as a typeface. This isn’t always (ever?) obvious at the start of a complex design project. Certainly, my understanding of it has evolved since the earliest versions, and seeing it in use by other designers has helped push my thinking forward.

So what is Name Sans?

Well, one simple answer is that it’s the font you’re reading right now – but it’s also much more than that.

As the tag line says, Name Sans is *a modern interpretation of the mosaic name tablets of the NYC Subway.*

When I first had the idea for this project as a new commuter in NYC about 5 years ago, I expected that I could dig up some kind of perfect blueprint for the signage, and work from that to make a revival. I have since seen a few tantalizing examples that are *close* to what I’d hope for, but finding a direct plan is much less simple than I initially thought it might be. So, instead, the drawings for Name Sans are not a direct copy of scans from a dusty old type specimen, but rather the product of me experiencing and appreciating the Subway mosaics over time, taking countless photos and sketching ideas based on them while riding the train.

(Sidenote: if any transit archivists are reading this and know of specific blueprints or specifications that I might be interested in seeing, I’d be super appreciative to learn more or to be proven wrong! The [online archives](https://nytm.pastperfectonline.com/) are great, but understandably don’t contain images for every possible item. A [2019 exhibit](https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/program/changing-signs-changing-times-a-history-of-wayfinding-in-transit/eakhu-fxuaigwz_/) did include a few wonderful watercolors and pencil sketches, but not as many as I had hoped for. I haven’t yet been able to dig further into physical archives due to COVID-19, but I would very much like to see more!)

At one point, early on, I mentioned to an experienced type designer that I was thinking of making a typeface that would be a revival of the Subway mosaics. “Impossible!” they said, “what would you even revive?” At first I was taken aback and thought I could prove them wrong, but with time, I have understood what they meant.

Name Sans is not a *revival*, and it couldn’t be. There is no single, consistent “off-the-shelf” font. The system was built by [several separate companies over many decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway#History), with projects led by several different architects and carried out by different construction crews. Type revivals are recreations of fonts that were previously made with a different technology, like when a digital font is made to recreate the shape of letters original cast in lead for letterpress printing. The subway mosaics are a loose system of architectural lettering – not a singular typeface which one could “revive.”

But, in many ways, not having a single point of reference is exactly what has freed me to make this project what it needs to be: a typeface that respects the past but doesn’t get stuck in it. While there are clearly repeated lettering styles for different lines and different eras, something I love about the Subway is that there is *not* a perfectly-repeated system for the name tablets. If it was all just Helvetica and stations had a perfectly-repeated aesthetic, the Subway would be boring. (More practically, it would also simply be harder to know when you reached the right station. As a rider of the NYC Subway, you learn to identify stops by the color of tiles and the big lettering on the station walls. If you always had to look closely for Helvetica on uniformly–colored walls, you would end up missing stops a lot more often.)

Name Sans picks up on my favorite aspects of the Subway wayfinding system and brings them together into an extended Latin character set with wide range of weights and optical sizes. If I had gotten stuck on finding just *one* thing to revive, I wouldn’t have had the flexibility to really explore what is useful in a geometric-grotesque sans – and what is newly possible in type today.

For starters, the mosaics only contain the basic English uppercase alphabet, plus numbers and a few extra symbols like arrows and ampersands. I was always going to have to invent the lowercase, extended Latin alphabet, accents, and symbol set. But beyond that, the mosaics only have a narrow range of weights – roughly “Medium” to “Bold” – and only have a sign-specific range of sizes – large to huge, though typically seen from a distance. In my mind, any truly-useful modern typeface should offer a wider typographic palette to its users. Additionally, type is most versatile if it’s designed for the scales and contexts we tend to engage with type at on screens and in print, most often in longer strings than single Subway station names.

Working from more than a single blueprint has also revealed possibilities beyond size & weight ranges. Rather than picking only the most common style of a uppercase, I have made two – a default set that looks pretty much how you’d expect a geometric sans to look, plus a stylistic set (`ss01`) that takes on the flat-sided, rectangular shaping of the mosaics used in many of the stations outside of Manhattan. A difficult part has been deciding which `R` to borrow from the system – the more common, basic construction with a straight leg, or the intrinsically-mosaic approach to a grotesque `R` with a leg “kick”? Well, it’s a modern typeface, so I could include both! And then, it’s a modern typeface, so why not add a few other things fit for modern expectations, like a single-story `a`?

And thus, I have sought to make a typeface that captures the best energy and spirit of the Subway mosaics, but which is genuinely useful to designers working in digital systems and graphic design. I hope that Name Sans may also get used in wayfinding (and certain decisions have been made to enable this), but it is designed first and foremost for the place I encounter typography the most: the Web.

## Formal design qualities

### Geometry, but with nuance

A striking, obvious trait of the mosaics is that the circular letters get to be *circles.* In type, a circle never really looks like a circle, but I’ve iterated a lot to get as close as possible to a circular basis for letters like `O C G Q o c` – and adjusted the amount of circularity for optical sizes, because when you’re reading, anything close to an actual circle will look strangely wide.

At all optical sizes, I have refrained from pursuing circles for letters like `b d p q`, instead drawing them with optical compensation to more closely match the average visual width of the `o` and `n`, to help establish a visual rhythm that doesn’t call too much attention to itself. I find that if the `b d p q` are drawn with bowls that are too circular, a typeface takes on a tone that becomes purely decorative.

Even though I love typefaces like [Avant Garde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITC_Avant_Garde) and [Futura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)) and many of the projects inspired by them, I could never take a sign, website, or app interface very seriously if it were to use exclusively type with such rigid geometry.

Even though I want to capture the charm of the Subway mosaics, charm is not only achieved through decoration. Instead, I seek to create something which balances geometry and nuance. I want to create something that can offer genuine utility in a wide range of applications. So, in Name Sans, the not-quite-circularity is just as critical as the circularity.

### Sharpness

A subtlety I love about the Subway mosaics is that diagonal vertices don’t simply have a one-stroke width, as you might achieve if you were trying to make a purely “elemental” letterform. Instead, they almost always increase the sharpness of vertices to something closer to about 2/3 stroke thickness. This gives vertices more sharpness, visually suggesting that diagonal letters are made in a single motion, rather than from separate strokes.

Almost all of the sans-serifs that easily come to mind take one extreme or the other on their treatment of vertices. Broadly speaking, they either take the *Futura* route with razor-sharp points, or else the *Helvetica* route of prioritizing evenness of strokes, proportions, and color and not really considering vertices as a thing to preserve. I like that the mosaics take a practical approach that is a little bit sharp, but in a subtle way that doesn’t call attention to itself, and I have sought to preserve this in all but the very thickest weights of Name Sans.

It comes from a slightly different logical basis – less stroke-based on more abstracted – but I have extended this quality of sharpness to the meeting points (AKA “crotches”) of lowercase letters like `n m b d g p q`. Rather than trying to suggest a single, monolinear vertical stem on these letters, I have borrow the idea of sharpness to give a little more whitespace to these corners, while also avoiding needed to overly pinch the strokes connecting bowls. Would the original architects have done it this way? It’s hard to say – possibly not. But, this move allows the typeface to work together in a way that maintains a sense of sharpness, while also remaining a cohesive sense of each letter being a self-contained little entity that works smoothly with its neighbors.

### Playing with Optical compensation, both exagerated and ignored

There is so much that could be included to when describing the personality of the Subway mosaics, and I suspect that any given type designer might pick up on something different.

For me, though, a core of the personality is the way the signage handles *optical compensations,* or the ways letters are often formed in slightly unintuitive ways to handle the ways our eyes perceive them.

In almost every widely-used typeface, there is a small amount of optical compensation that tends to follow a predictable pattern (at least once you know what to look for): horizontal strokes are a little thinner than vertical strokes, and the bottom “halves” of letters are a little bigger than the tops. And yes, as mentioned above, “circles” are never really circles. This becomes apparent if you flip a font like Helvetica sideways or upside-down.

[Helvetica H upright vs on its side]

[Helvetica S upright vs flipped]

Meanwhile, the mosaic letters can – and do – either completely exaggerate or completely disregard the rules of optical compensation. For one, the tiles don’t tend to modulate thickness between vertical and horizontal strokes, because they are roughly square. But also, the `S` tends to exaggerate its form by being much wider on the bottom than at the top, while the `B` will contrast this with two bowls that completely match in size. The `E` has a middle bar that is super-short, while the `5` forgoes a typical slanted top-left.

Just as perfect circles don’t work in practice at the scale we tend to use type, I’ve had to moderate the extremes to make sense. But, I’ve kept a taper in the `S`, I’ve kept vertical and horizontal strokes as nearly-monolinear as they could be, I’ve kept the `B` nearly vertically-symmetrical, I’ve kept a short mid bar on the `E`, and I’ve kept an upright `5`. For every quirk in Name Sans, there is a mosaic letter that led me to make that quirk.

As an extra note, the Subway mosaics can get away flaunting optical compensation to such a degree in part because they are large, and because they never really have that much text. In making Name Sans, I have found that the larger optical sizes can come close to matching that stubborn approach, while smaller optical sizes work best if they introduce progressively more optical compensation.

### Rigidity & Fluidity

Often times, the most striking feature of the Subway mosaics is how they seem to defy the physics you might expect of rectangular tiles. The way that letters will gracefully, fluidly curve sometimes seems like the makers were just showing off. (This is even more striking in the serif styles of lettering, but that is a topic for another project.)

- [ ] TODO: [Spring street] 

- [ ] TODO: [8 for 8th ave - or maybe just a series of close-ups?]

But also, there are plenty of moments where the grid of tiles is embraced and where the rectangularity of tiles is allowed to guide the stroke they create. Flat-sided round letters are an obvious example of this. In a broader sense, the strict use of uppercase-only letters is another example of this – uppercase letters eschew many of the complex curvature and details that lowercase letters require.

Without direct examples, I have had to invent a lowercase for Name Sans. One way I have tried to capture the idea of mosaic lettering is to embrace flat portions of letters, juxtaposed against other moments of fluidity, geometry, sharpness. Where curves would otherwise be “shallow” or present as optical corrections, I have allowed these to become completely flat, in a way that I think might be natural in tiled mosaics.

- [ ] TODO: [image of `t r g f l a`]

To an extent, I must admit, the decision to incorporate flat segments was also influenced by some of the vinyl Helvetica station signage. I love the way the `S` has a flat segment in its spine, and the way the `t` sometimes ends in a horizontal tail rather than its more-typical little upturn. I can’t really deny that Name Sans has modern influences, and this is another reason it is an interpretation rather than a revival.

### Obviousness

What is *simplicity*? It’s a much-debated question, but – at least when it comes to type – is somewhere between impossible and counterproductive. Is *simplicity* an absolute minimum of shaping detail? Partially yes – but if taken too far, that definition might lead to letterforms without necessary optical compensations, which looks terrible in practice. Is *simplicity* repeating what we are already used to seeing and reading? Partially yes – but if taken too far, that definition would conclude that we already have exactly the type we need and would forgo the possibility of ever making things better than what we already have. 

What is obvious? That is a question that is more straightforward, though partly because it assumes an individual perspective. What is obvious to one person is not necessarily obvious to another. In designing Name Sans, I have tried to make design decisions according to what the obvious, elemental forms of letters are, as informed by what I have observed in the Subway mosaics as well.

A primary example: the terminal angles and aperture tightness of sans-serif letters have a big impact on the tone of a typeface.

In early versions of Name Sans, the apertures of letters like `C`, `S`, & `a` were very “closed” in Display styles, and more open in Text styles. The logic was that, with tighter spacing in the Display styles, tighter aperatures kept letters more self-contained. But, as I contended with coming up with an explanation rooted in actual examples from Subway mosaics, I had to admit that this solution was too much of an invention of my own. It was too closely following type trends of the last few years – hardly something that would be *obvious* to the folks making signs many decades ago. So, I adjusted my terminals to be at a more obvious placement and angle. I prioritized what would make strokes appear to end with roughly-square ends, and what would be visually similar across the family. An exception to this comes in the Ultra styles, which are pretty unabashedly of my own invention, exagerating the system into purely-display styles. Here, the apertures do close off to avoid overly-large whitespaces in text.

An example, though with slightly different logic, is the way lowercase are constructed. These have joints that have smooth rather than sharp connections. Because the lowercase had to be invented from a relatively-sparse set of examples, one of the bigger decisions was whether to connect bowls to stems in letters like `n` and `b` with a smooth connection, as in “neo-grotesque” fonts like Helvetica, or whether to connect these with sharp connections, more in line with “humanist” gothic fonts like Franklin Gothic.

Uppercase letters don’t have that many opportunities to show this decision. The `G` does, occassionally, but there are few connections that relate to the more-cursive system that underlies the Latin lowercase. However, numbers do offer a few more opportunities for insight into what might be natural for the typeface.

There are number mosaics that suggest both strategies. **8th Street** uses a number `8` that has a humanist construction of a “single path” in a rotated ∞ shape. Meanwhile, **96th Street** has numbers with delightfully-circular counters. So, even though you might expect the signmakers to only create shapes that were convenient (presumably, humanist forms without smooth joints), they show time and again that they were interested more in aesthetics than in convenience.

Because these numbers offered direct precendents, I have chosen to follow both possible routes – Name Sans has a `6` & `9` with circular counters, but bucks the typical geo-grot approach, and instead uses a more-humanist form for `8`.

But, the lowercase did not have precendents, and therefore, I had to choose what looked more obvious in text. I will definitely admit that, because I spend hours of every day reading fonts like Helvetica and [Apple SF](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/), my eyes are biased. It could be that I chose to follow these precedents because I found them visually familiar, and knew others would as well. However, I do have a theory of *why* these smooth-joined forms have won out in so much of today’s graphic design: with smooth connections, letters feel like self-contained units. When it has a smooth connection between its steam and its bowl, a character like `n` is a **single thing** by itself, even though it has a complex shape. If, however, an `n` has a sharp connection, it presents itself as **two things** connected.

This theory isn’t really my own, though it felt like it when I decided that Name Sans should have smooth joins. In reality, the theory is really just another way of repeating [Gerrit Noordzij’s theory of The Stroke](https://hyphenpress.co.uk/products/books/978-0-907259-30-5) – that most type can be thought of as originating in the strokes of a writing tool. Noordzij breaks this down into categories which include *expansion* (in which the stroke’s width modulates according to pressure, as explified by a pointed-nib pen) and *translation* (in which the stroke’s wide modulates according to direction, as exemplified by writing with a flat-nibbed pen). In *expansion* writing – the basis for typefaces in the [Didone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didone_(typography)) genre – the pen makes the core of most letters which a single stroke, traveling down, up, over, and down, allowing for continuous strokes with smooth joins. In *translation* writing – the basis for styles from text-focused [Old-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif#Old-style) serifs to angular [Blackletter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter) script – the pen only travels in a downward or sideways direction, lending to separate strokes with sharp joins. (As with any model, the reality of writing systems is more complex, and fascinating concepts like single-stroke signpainting are ignored entirely. Still, it provides one useful perspective by which to consider the design of letters.)

All that is to say: Name Sans might have a smoothly-joined lowercase because Helvetica is perpetually popular and I am crassly chasing after money (I am running a business to sell a product to buyers, after all). But, Name Sans *also* has a smoothly-joined lowercase because it relates back to the idea that each letter should be a single, self-contained unit. Either way, this is the “obvious” choice!

### A varied but harmonious collection of styles

The thing that made this project “impossible” is something I have worked to bring into the project through both its range of styles, its nature as a variable font, and its OpenType features.

*Stylistic Sets* are an option that a font can include to allow users to activate various stylistic variants of characters, like (depending on the typeface) a single-story `a` or serif `I`. Stylistic sets are something of a joke in type design circles because they can make a project (sometimes significantly) harder to complete, and then often go totally unknown to the actual users of a font. (This is partly due to their usually-terrible UI in design software; *cough* thanks, Adobe *cough*). Some type designers will even suggest that stylistic sets indicate a lack of decisiveness on the part of a creator, almost to the point of it being a moral failing to do otherwise. “Pick the best letterform for each character and stick with it,” they advise, “that’s your job as a type designer.”

There is certainly some merit to pushing back on overly-enthusiastic stylistic sets and features for the sake of features. But, sometimes, it’s nice to have a tool that can do more than one thing.

In the case of Name Sans, I would see it as a major missed opportunity to disregard the many, many stations that have rectangular caps for their mosaic signage. So, rectangular caps can be activated with Stylistic Set 1.

I would also see it as a missed opportunity to bring in my favorite `R` from stations like Spring Street and Bowery. But, I have had to face the fact that an `R` with a curly leg doesn’t always work, and probably doesn’t work most of the time – it’s just too much more interesting than the letters around it. So, the default `R` is a simple shape with a straight leg, but the cooler “grotesque” form can be activated with Stylistic Set 2.

And then, I would also find it a shame to choose just one form of `g` for both very large sizes (which should usually be a single-story `g`) and for text sizes (which should usually be a double-story `g`). So, again, this gets a stylistic set.

#### Size-specific letterforms

In earlier versions of Name Sans, the Optical Size axis automatically switched between forms of characters `R I g l`, opting for the forms that I felt worked best in Display vs Text scenarios. This was partly a nod to old grotesque typefaces that switched between very different letterforms at different widths and sizes.

- [ ] TODO: add link?

In previous versions of Name Sans, there were stylistic sets to turn off this size-specific swapping behavior. In v0.5, however, I have opted to keep a single set of defaults across all sizes – with stylistic sets to turn *on* the automatic swaps.

Why the change? For one, having stylistic sets to turn off behavior got very confusing to coordinate between variable and static fonts – even for me, as the font maker. But also, I had to be honest with myself: if I were a graphic designer, I would probably be confused and maybe a bit annoyed with a font that radically changed shapes at different sizes.

At the same time, as a type-minded designer, I really *like* having a font that changes shape for different sizes. It’s *useful* if small or running text has a more-recognizable `g`, and it’s pretty cool if a headline has a wonky `R`. So, for folks who want to use Name Sans in this kind of “expert” mode, Stylistic Sets 20 & 19 will turn on these size-specific substitutions. If you’re defining your text styles in CSS or in a high-level Paragraph style, this is simple enough to do, but it’s also nice to have a more-predictable font for everyday use.

And on top of all that, there are a set of stylistic sets that are just nice to have in any geometric sans. Of course, there is a single-story `a`, but there are also simplified versions of `t`, `j`, `y`, and an alternate German etzett (borrowing an “blackletter” letter construction from Berlin street signage).

### Extra quirks

For whatever reason, the `Z` has a little angle at the bottom right, even though this isn’t found in any other uppercase letter. But, it really does happen in multiple places, so I’ve kept this. To carry this nuance into the system a little further, I’ve matched this slight calligraphic touch at the top of the `t`.

In the `ss01` Rectangular Caps, the `U` has a bottom which is more square than the bottoms of letters like `O` that you’d think might match. Again, this comes from repeated examples from mosaics.

The number `5` has a totally-vertical top-left part in many mosaics, so this is preserved in the Display styles of Name Sans (though it is angled in Text styles, and in-between in Standard styles).

Simply put, Name Sans is not an accidental design. Every visual aspect of it ties back to mosaics signage in the Subway. There are still a few decisions that I am turning over in my head and in my sketches, but I am becoming more and more certain that I am finding the right way to balance things into a varied but cohesive type family.

## There’s so much more I could say

Like Name Sans itself, this blog post is really only a partially-complete draft. There is so much more I could say about the typeface, the ideas I have tried and abandoned, and the things it can do. Some of these are better outlined in the PDF Specimen and in the slides on Future Fons. But also, I am still in the midst of discovering what Name Sans is! To me, that’s the fun of it.

There are a few things I am pretty certain of: I will be adding Italics along with a more typographic goodies, and I will be making continued refinements to shaping, spacing, and kerning.

I hope to finish and fully release a `1.0` in the coming months. When I do, I plan to have a more-complete essay about its history and its design.

If you’ve already picked up a license for Name Sans, I really appreciate you coming along for the journey! If you haven’t, it’s still at a greatly-reduced price while it’s in pre-release (if you do the math, it’s currently about $4 per style). By [purchasing a license through Future Fonts](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/arrowtype/name-sans), you will be securing future updates for free, for life.

I hope you consider picking up a license, and I hope you reach out to me when you put it to use! I love to see when people have put my fonts to work – it really makes this whole, occasionally-ridiculous effort feel worthwhile.
