        Hi, I’m Stephen Nixon. I make fonts as <a href="https://arrowtype.com">Arrow Type</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        My first forays into coding were for the web, using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript – topics for which there are a near-infinite number questions & answers readily available through simple web searches. In type design, meanwhile, I have often struggled to find as much information as I’d like, so I’ve had to come up with new strategies for figuring things out.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m an avid note-taker, so I’ve tried to do my part to make more information available in type. I like to write down what I learn, and whenever I can, I make it publicly available so that it might help others.
