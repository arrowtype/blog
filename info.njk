        Notes on type design & development
    </h1>

    <p>
        Hi, I’m Stephen Nixon. I design & develop fonts as <a href="https://arrowtype.com">Arrow Type</a>.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Letters are magic. An alphabet is a small number of characters, and yet it can convey infinite possibilities. Drawing letters is a beautiful way to engage with language & culture, and making <strong>fonts</strong> is a way to make things that others can use. I feel very lucky that I have had some opportunities to learn about making type that is well-crafted and functional. However, I am still just getting started in an expansive field. I have had many generous mentors along the way, and it is my goal to share what I learn so that others can learn, too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many type foundries have released a wide array extremely informative and helpful blog posts, lectures, books, and tools. Still, there is a lot of room for more information. Not only is the field continually evolving, but technology is advancing rapidly – both within and beyond type.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a designer, my first forays into code were for the web, using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. These are topics for which there are a near-infinite number questions & answers readily available through simple web searches. If you Google a question, you will tend to find answers. But, starting in type design, I found it a much bigger challenge to find as much information as I wanted, so I’ve had to come up with new strategies for figuring things out.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m an avid notetaker, so when I do learn something new, I try to write it down so I can look it up later if I need to. I’ve tried to extend this habit as a way to do my part to make more information available in type. Whenever I can, I make it publicly available so that it might help others. Sometimes that’s in a public GitHub Issue, sometimes that’s in a forum post, and sometimes, that’s in a blog post. Mostly, I just want to make sure there are a few more answers when other designers (or myself, in the future) search with questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this spirit, I have approached this blog a little differently than might be typical for a type foundry. I have set it up as an open-source project, so others can learn from my code, point out errors, and learn from my in-progress posts. Some of my posts will be formal: explanations of new type releases, refined explanations of design theory & methods. But, most of my posts will be less-formal explanations of things I’ve learned and think others might find useful.
    </p>

        Here’s to seeking & sharing knowledge!
